# Software Company Practice

## Context

This project has been created during participation in a
[video course](https://www.udemy.com/course/implement-high-fidelity-designs-with-material-ui-and-reactjs/) by 
Zachary Reece at Udemy. The graphical design is exactly the same as presented in the course, however variety of 
optimizations and improvements have been applied to improve code quality.
